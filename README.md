# ü§î Problem space

## Problems to solve/Requirements to Create

A potential client might need a website or platform with faster load times, enhanced SEO, and improved performance. The challenge is balancing server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side interactivity without compromising user experience. The solution should optimize data fetching, minimize resource consumption, and deliver static content quickly while maintaining dynamic functionality for a seamless user experience.

### üëâ Problem: Slow Initial Page Load

**Problem Statement:**\
Web pages with heavy media files or large datasets often suffer from slow initial load times, negatively affecting user experience, especially on slower networks or devices.

**Current Solution:**\
Lazy loading delays loading non-essential content (e.g., images or videos) until the user needs it, such as when they scroll to that part of the page. This minimizes initial load time and reduces resource usage, providing a faster and smoother user experience.

**How do we know it is a problem:**

- User feedback: Users complain about long loading times for image-heavy or media-rich pages.

- Metrics: High bounce rates and low engagement on pages with large files.

- Evidence: Performance tools report poor LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and TTI (Time to Interactive) scores.

### üëâ Problem: Slow Rendering and Delayed User Interaction

**Problem Statement:**\
Pages that are dynamically rendered on each request can lead to slower loading times, especially for static content that doesn't change frequently. This impacts the user experience and affects website performance.

**Current Solution:**\
**Static Rendering (SSG) in Next.js** pre-renders pages at build time, creating static HTML files that can be served instantly to users. This significantly reduces load times for pages with static content, improving user experience and boosting performance by eliminating the need for server-side processing on every request.

**How do we know it is a problem:**

- User feedback: Users express frustration with delayed interactivity and slower navigation.

- Metrics: Increased TTI, low user satisfaction scores.

- Evidence: Performance tests show that dynamic rendering is causing unnecessary delays in loading static content.

### üëâ Problem: Challenges with Server Components in Next.js

**Problem Statement:**\
Server components in Next.js can lead to potential issues such as increased complexity in managing the client-server boundary, limited interactivity, and difficulties in handling certain client-side features, like state management or event handling. Additionally, debugging server components can be more challenging since they are rendered on the server.

**Current Solution:**\
While server components help with performance and SEO, careful consideration of when and where to use them, along with combining them with client components for interactivity, can mitigate these challenges.

**How do we know it is a problem:**

- User feedback: Developers report challenges in handling interactivity with server-rendered components.

- Metrics: Increased development time due to debugging issues and state management complexities.

- Evidence: Feedback and development logs show a slower development process due to poor integration of server components.

---

## Why solve these problems?

- **Reason 1:** Improving page load times and rendering efficiency is crucial for enhancing user experience, increasing engagement, and reducing bounce rates.

- **Reason 2:** Simplifying the use of server components ensures faster development cycles, reduces complexity, and enables a more interactive user experience.

**User Satisfaction Matrix:**

- **Current state:** Users face frustration with slow loading times and delayed interactivity.

- **Desired state:** After implementing the solutions, users will experience faster page loads, smoother interactions, and seamless content delivery.
